This version of the FRC2012 project controls adds Microsoft Kinect functionality in teleop mode.

The kinect controls the shooter, effectively replacing all of the commands on Joystick 3 related to shooting with Kinect gestures.
This function does not always run, the default is too only allow control from the joystick.
Control is toggled between the joystick and kinect by switching the throttle on joystick 2 all the way up or all the way down.
